      <p>[My dearest lovely, Varada,

	Happy delightful 2 months my love. These wonderful 2 months with you have been an absolute dream come true. My pumpkin, you have shown me all the best parts of what love truly is and what it can accomplish. One thought of you and I am immediately put at ease, everything else ceases to exist to me. You effortlessly ground me and keep on my feet whether itâ€™s about school, work, coaching, being a sibling, a daughter, a dog owner, or a girlfriend. 

	School, however hard has been so much easier with you, your support and your presence. I honestly would not have been able to survive those two months without you by my side. Coaching has been a true dream come true for me and being able to share it with you and having you by my side through it all, starting as a friendly invite to plotting on how I can always have you these so that I can share this part of my life with you, everything has been so incredibly magical. Already you know how much your support means to me, having been surrounded by sports my whole life, but having had it so empty in an emotional capacity, being able to openly share with someone as significant as you has been all new to me. Nonetheless, you managed to wash all my worries away when it came down to any of it, from my worries with kids, to my ability, to my planning, you were able to tranquillize each part. I owe you an immense gratitude for everything youâ€™ve done for me. Stealing your time, costs a great ton, a ton that Iâ€™ll forever owe you back. Work, however occupied it keeps me, makes it all ever worth it when Iâ€™m reminded of everything I can spend my money on for you. Though you say I shouldnâ€™t, and of course Iâ€™ll try my best not too. In general work is much less work with the thoughts of you running in my mind. Simple thoughts that fuel me through the day, and make me work harder. Being a sibling and a daughter has always been my role for quite a while, and never have I thought of it as much as when I met you and realized how much of it with have in common. Talking and sharing stories with you has made me more thankful for all the memories and treasure that I am both lucky yet burdened to carry in terms of family status. As much as mommy issues or daddy issues I may carry, talking about it with you has become a sacred haven that I can be extremely comfortable in. In addition to family, Sparkle has been my love since the first day we brought her home and I could carry her little frail body in my fucking palms, thatâ€™s how small she was. As much as I persist I want to eat her, find her zipper or kick her, truly that dog is my actual best friend, from sensing when Iâ€™m sick, tired or stress, Sparkle knows it all just from one glance and she knows how to immediately cheer me up. Now you, you have become another Sparkle for me, a Sparkle in human form. As much as Sparkle is my best friend she truly is just me in dog form, and itâ€™s just my luck that my best friend also fell in love with my girlfriend. Truly I have never seen Sparkle warm up to a person in a span of 10 minutes, you had her under a spell so fast my love. Though I canâ€™t say I blame her, who wouldnâ€™t fall for you, it is daunting to say the least, just because of how much more adorable she is compared to me. And to say Iâ€™m jealous of a dog, well lowkey, thatâ€™s got to be one of the most embarrassing  things ever. But, alas, I definitely would be more jealous of her if you two get more time together, butttt at the same time, I am over the moon overjoyed at how well my dog and girlfriend get along with one another. She truly does miss you, but she doesnâ€™t miss you as much as I do. Lastly being your girlfriend, am I ever so lucky to be able to name myself your girlfriend. As in I AM VARADA SARMAâ€™S GIRLFRIEND. Like what the freak, what did do in my past life to be able to get that title and honour, truly I donâ€™t think I deserve it whatsoever, buttt it is the only think I could ever dream of before I even knew it was a dream to be had. 

By my calculations if you are reading this on the 15th, we would have been together for at least 62 days, 1 488 hours, 89 280 minutes, and 5 356 800 seconds, in theory it sounds like a lot, in my head it doesnâ€™t sound enough, but alas patience is key because we have all of the future ahead of us. However to commemorate the 62 days Iâ€™ve been blessed with, with having you in my life, here are 62 things I love about you or us. ]</p>
